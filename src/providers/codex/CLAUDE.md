# Codex Provider

Adaptor for OpenAI Codex via `codex app-server` over stdio JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Protocol Overview

The app-server speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (newline-delimited JSON) with a required startup handshake and three ongoing message flows:
- **Startup handshake**: client sends `initialize`, then notifies `initialized`
- **Client → Server** (request/response): `thread/*`, `turn/*`, `skills/list`
- **Server → Client** (notifications): streaming deltas, item events, `turn/completed`, usage
- **Server → Client → Server** (server requests): approval gates, user input requests — the server asks a question, the client responds

The `initialize` handshake is mandatory and must include `{ experimentalApi: true }` to unlock extended capabilities. Wire types are probed against a specific app-server version in `codexAppServerTypes.ts`.

## Design Decisions

### Live Streaming Uses Raw JSON-RPC

Live turn output is streamed from `codex app-server` JSON-RPC notifications. `thread/start` and `thread/resume` request `experimentalRawEvents: true`, and `CodexNotificationRouter` projects both normalized item notifications and raw `rawResponseItem/completed` payloads into Claudian `StreamChunk`s.

**Why raw RPC owns live output**: polling the provider JSONL transcript during an active turn makes renderer work scale with total transcript size. Raw JSON-RPC preserves the provider-native `function_call`, `function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call`, and `custom_tool_call_output` payloads without rereading the transcript file.

JSONL remains the provider-owned replay source for history hydration and session-file discovery. Do not reintroduce live JSONL polling unless the app-server stops emitting an equivalent raw notification and the tradeoff is documented with a current wire trace.

### Skill Listing Via Ephemeral Process

`CodexSkillListingService` spawns a **separate short-lived app-server process** for each `skills/list` RPC call (TTL-cached for 5 seconds). This avoids coupling skill discovery to the chat runtime lifecycle — skills can be listed even when no chat is active, and skill discovery errors can't crash the main runtime.

### Environment Hash Invalidation

`codexSettingsReconciler` watches `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Any hash change invalidates all existing Codex sessions (clears `sessionId` and `providerState`), preventing the UI from trying to resume sessions against a different API endpoint.

## Non-Obvious Behaviors

### Thread Resume Requirement

The app-server requires `thread/resume` before any operation on an existing thread in a new daemon process. `loadedThreadId` tracks which thread has been resumed in the current daemon session. If the process is killed and restarted, the next query will resume the thread first. For forks, `thread/resume` must be called on the **new fork** (not the source) before `thread/rollback`.

### Pending Turn Notification Buffering

The server may emit notifications before the client has processed the `turn/start` RPC response and set `currentTurnId`. These early notifications buffer in `pendingTurnNotifications` and flush once the turn ID is established.

### Compact Turn ID

For normal turns, the turn ID comes from the `turn/start` RPC response. For compact (`thread/compact/start`), the response is `{}` with no turn ID — the ID is established when the `turn/started` notification arrives. `routeNotification` handles this special case.

### JSONL Format Duality

A single session file may contain both legacy (`type: 'event'`) and modern (`type: 'event_msg'`, `type: 'response_item'`) records. The parser scans all records and uses the modern path if any modern records are present. A `type: 'compacted'` record completely resets the turn context and replays from `replacement_history`.

### Image Lifecycle

Images are written to a temp directory (`os.tmpdir()/claudian-codex-images-{random}/`), passed as `{ type: 'localImage', path }` inputs, and cleaned up in the `query()` `finally` block.

### `serverRequest/resolved`

The server can resolve approval/ask-user requests without waiting for client input (e.g., timeout). The `serverRequest/resolved` notification auto-dismisses the pending approval/ask-user UI.

## Gotchas

- `CodexAuxQueryRunner` uses its own separate process + transport + thread — completely independent from the chat runtime
- `CodexTaskResultInterpreter` is all no-ops — Claudian's async agent task system (used for Claude) doesn't apply to Codex
- Session file paths may include a date prefix (`{date}-{threadId}.jsonl`) — `findCodexSessionFile` handles both patterns via DFS fallback
- Codex is opt-in: `isEnabled()` defaults to `false`
