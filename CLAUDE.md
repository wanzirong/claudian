# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Claudian is an Obsidian plugin that embeds provider-backed chat runtimes in a sidebar and inline-edit flow. Claude is the default provider. Codex is optional and joins the same conversation model through `Conversation.providerId` plus provider-owned `providerState`.

## Architecture Status

- Product status: Claudian is a multi-provider product. Claude is the full-feature provider. Codex is opt-in and currently supports send, stream, cancel, resume, history reload, fork, plan mode, image attachments, inline edit, `#` instruction mode, `$` skills, and subagents. Unsupported or gated Codex surfaces are rewind, runtime-discovered provider commands, in-app MCP management, and Claude plugin integration.
- App shell: `src/app/` owns shared settings defaults and plugin-level storage helpers. `src/core/` owns provider-neutral runtime, registry, tool, and type contracts.
- Provider boundary: `src/core/runtime/` and `src/core/providers/` define the chat-facing seam. `ProviderRegistry` creates runtimes and provider-owned auxiliary services. `ProviderWorkspaceRegistry` owns workspace services such as command catalogs, agent mention providers, CLI resolution, MCP managers, and provider settings tabs.
- Claude adaptor: `src/providers/claude/` owns the Claude runtime, prompt encoding, stream transforms, history hydration, CLI resolution, plugin and agent discovery, MCP storage, and Claude-specific settings UI. `ClaudeCommandCatalog` merges vault commands, vault skills, and runtime-supported commands behind the shared command catalog contract.
- Codex adaptor: `src/providers/codex/` owns the `codex app-server` runtime, JSON-RPC transport, prompt encoding, raw live stream projection, JSONL history reload, settings reconciliation, normalization, skill cataloging, subagent storage, and Codex settings UI. `CodexSkillCatalog` provides `$` skill discovery from `.codex/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` without relying on runtime command discovery.
- Conversations: `Conversation` carries `providerId` and opaque `providerState`. Claude state is typed behind `ClaudeProviderState`. Codex state is typed behind `CodexProviderState` and currently stores `threadId`, `sessionFilePath`, and optional fork metadata.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test -- --selectProjects unit
npm run test -- --selectProjects integration
npm run test:coverage -- --selectProjects unit
```

Tests mirror the `src/` layout under `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`.

## Development Notes

- **Provider-native first**: Prefer the official Claude SDK and Codex app-server behavior over reimplementing provider features locally. When the provider already owns a capability, adapt to it instead of shadowing it.
- **Runtime exploration**: For provider integrations, inspect real runtime output first. Claude data lands under `~/.claude/` and Codex data under `~/.codex/`. Real transcripts beat guessed event shapes. Put throwaway local scripts in `.context/`; only promote durable tooling into `dev/`.
- **Comments**: Comment why, not what. Avoid narration and redundant JSDoc.
- **TDD workflow**: For new behavior or bug fixes, write the failing test first in the mirrored `tests/` path, make it pass, then refactor.
- Run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` after editing.
- No `console.*` in production code.
- Put non-committed notes, handoff files, and throwaway scripts in `.context/`.
